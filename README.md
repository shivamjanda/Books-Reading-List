# Reading-List

Program that can store and retrieve information related to a user's reading list

1. Users should be able to add a book (use functions) to their reading list by providing a book title, an author's name, and a year of publication.
2. The program should store information about all these books in a file called books.csv, and this data should be stored in CSV format.
3. Users should be able to retrieve the books (use functions) in their reading list, and these books should be printed out in a user-friendly format.
4. Users should be able to search (use functions) for a specific book by providing a book title.
5. Users should be able to select these options from a text menu, and they should be able to perform multiple operations without restarting the program. At the best, the menu should have at least the options of adding the book, listing of all books, searching a particular book, and quit the application.
